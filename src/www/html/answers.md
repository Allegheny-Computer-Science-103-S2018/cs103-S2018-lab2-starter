# A Web Site Created by Gregory M. Kapfhammer

I am learning more about how to apply styles and to run servers.

## Explain and show all of the commands you typed to convert to HTML.

Please explain the steps that you used to perform both conversions. The commands
should be included in the following blocks.

## Find at least one code block inside of a CSS file and try to explain it.

Please find a segment of code in a CSS file and explain it.

## How does your server return the HTML and CSS file(s) to the client?

Please explain all relevant details about the server's use of HTML and CSS.

## What error code does the server return when it can or cannot find a file?

Please refer to the codes that are in Table 2.1 of the textbook. Don't forget to
show the server's output in a fenced code block.

## Create a table that summarizes the meaning of at least three error codes.

The following table should include your own intuitive description of at least
three error codes. Your table should have the same format as the one in Table
2.1 on page 61 of your textbook.
